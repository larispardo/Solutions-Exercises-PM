    "The knapsack problem is a problem  is a problem in [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization): Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting problem since is an [NP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR2oDYZ-Sao) pronblem, this means that there is not a polinomial way to resolve this porblem and it is hard. In simple words it means that there is not one alorithm that will always lead you to the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still the problem is simple, if you have a knapsack with a maximum weiht, and a bunch of articles with weihts and values, how do I optimize the way I put them all together in mu knapsack in order for them to maximize my value.\n",
